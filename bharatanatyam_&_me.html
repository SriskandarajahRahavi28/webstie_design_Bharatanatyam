        <p class="text1">Now, I want to talk a little bit about Bharatanatyam's impact on me! Bharatanatyam has been an art I have been learning since I was 7. It's been an 
        essential part of my life for the longest time, and it’s truly been an amazing experience for me. Bharatanatyam has been a way for me to grow as a person 
        and learn more about my culture and identity. When I was little, this was the only way for me to understand what my culture represented and what it stood 
        for. My teacher and classmates taught me about the importance of this dance and the life lessons that I use in my everyday life. Not just as a dancer but 
        also as a member of the Tamil community.</p>
        
        <p class="text1">Bharatanatyam is not only about the lavish costumes or setups; it's also about the representation of emotion, expression, and storytelling of past 
        events. I believe that a Bharatanatyam dancer should be able to convey a story with or without lavish costumes. Our goal as dancers is to entertain the audience and
        pertain to our roots of serving God.</p>
        
        <p class="text1">However, as new fusion styles emerge and are incorporated into Bharatnatyam, I am also excited to discover and learn these new styles. These new fusion 
        styles are far ahead of our ancient roots, but I think they are creating an interesting space for dancers to express themselves in two different time periods, both 
        coming together at the same time. Bharatanatyam has always been about grace and beauty, and adding elements of more modern dances definitely gives us dancers more space 
        for creativity. So as a Bharatanatyam dancer myself, I'd like to explore Bharatanatyam and hip-hop fusion dancing, as it seems like a cool modern twist that attracts 
        both classical dancers as well as Tamil-cinema dancers.</p>
        
        <p class="text1">In the coming years, I would like to perform my debut performance and become an instructor at my teacher’s school. I would like to perform more often and hope 
        dance will become an integral part of my life. Here are some photos from the years of my dance career. Every single one of these is a stepping stone to where I am now.</p>
