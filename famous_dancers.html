    <h1>Famous Artists</h1>
    <h2>Rukmini Devi Arundale</h2>
    <p class="text1">Rukmini Devi Arundale was one of the key dancers to revive Bharatanatyam after it was banned by the British during their colonial rule over India. She is credited with disassociating Bharatanatyam from its Devadasi origin, a part of Bharatanatyam she thought was no longer needed. She toured with her husband all over Europe and worked to restore Bharatanatyam to its former glory. Ms. Arundale developed new ways for dancers to wear jewellery, makeup, and costumes. She also expanded and remodeled the instrumental use for Bharatanatyam performances, going from 1 instrument to around 4-5. After her reintroduction and reformation of Bharatanatyam for mainstream audiences all over the world, the era of post-colonial Bharatanatyam began. Her work to modernize Bharatanatyam was highly praised, and Mrs. Arundale was even offered the post of President of India for all her hard work, which she turned down. Up until she died in 1986, Mrs. Arundale created various pieces surrounding ancient Hindu mythological epics and stories, one of which was the "Ramayana", a story that is still well-known today. Mrs. Arundale is known to have had a crucial role in reviving Bharatanatyam and is a vital part of Bharatanatyamâ€™s 2000+ years of history.</p>

    <h2>Alarmel Valli</h2>
    <p class="text1">Ms. Valli is a renowned Bharatanatyam dancer, most famous for her performance at the 1972 International Dance Festival of the Sarah Bernhardt Theatre De La Ville in Paris. Ms. Valli is also the most mainstream Bharatanatyam from her time. She is known for having graceful and extremely feminine movements, all of which attest to her contributions to the Pandanallur style of Bharatanatyam. She is also the youngest recipient of the Padma Shri award, which she received in 1991. Throughout her career, she has performed on stages worldwide and participated in India's most prestigious cultural events. She has been everywhere from Berlin, to London, to Chennai and anywhere else in between!

    <h2>M.K. Saroja</h2>
    <p class="text1">M.K. Saroja is known for setting Bharatanatyam on a global stage to be enjoyed by people all over the world. M.K. Saroja is remembered for continuing Rukmini Devi's legacy and, even so, not being caught up by fame or money. After her 1940 debut performance, she became very well-known in her community and began performing more often. However, once she became a teacher, she mostly took her time off performing and stayed focused on her students. She was a loyal teacher, training her students to the best of her ability and educating them on other matters as well. From 1970 to 2000, M.K. Saroja remained at the Centre Mandapa in Paris, where she taught various students. After 40 years of teaching, M.K. Saroja retired in 2000. She is remembered as a "Dance Icon" in the Bharatanatyam community and is praised for her unwavering loyalty to her students, many of whom became famous and world-renowned themselves. She passed away in 2022 at the age of 91.</p>
